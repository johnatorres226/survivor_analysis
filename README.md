Title: Survival Analysis of Clinical Data with Cox Proportional Hazards Model

Description:
This project involves a comprehensive survival analysis of clinical data using the Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model. The goal is to predict patient outcomes based on a variety of clinical and demographic features. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model fitting, validation, and sensitivity analysis. Key components of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Model Fitting: Using the Cox Proportional Hazards model to analyze the impact of various covariates on survival times.
Model Validation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as concordance index and proportional hazards assumption tests.
Sensitivity Analysis: Investigating the impact of outliers and influential observations on the model's results.
Visualization: Generating plots to explore relationships between residuals and follow-up times, and assessing the influence of various features.
Features:

Data Preparation: Scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and encoding.
CoxPH Model: Implementation and fitting of the Cox Proportional Hazards model using the lifelines library.
Validation: Code for computing and interpreting validation metrics.
Sensitivity Analysis: Techniques for identifying and analyzing outliers and influential data points.
Plots and Visualizations: Visual representations of model diagnostics and analysis results.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, lifelines, statsmodels
Jupyter Notebook or similar environment for interactive analysis
Usage:

Load and preprocess your dataset using the provided scripts.
Fit the Cox Proportional Hazards model to your data.
Evaluate the model using validation metrics and plots.
Perform sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of outliers.
